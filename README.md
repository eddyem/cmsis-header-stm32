## CMSIS device headers for STM32

This folder includes the CMSIS device headers for all STM32 devices.
The files located here are part of the `STM32Cube` libraries and can be found inside the `STM32Cube*/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32F*xx/Include` folder.

The files are copied and modified by converting all line endings from Windows to Unix style and removing all trailing whitespace (see `post_script.sh`).

Here is the list of the current device header version and release date as well as the Cube release version in braces:

The Travis CI integration checks these versions daily and will update them automatically.
However, when our manual patches fail to apply, the CI will fail: [![](https://travis-ci.org/modm-io/cmsis-header-stm32.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/modm-io/cmsis-header-stm32)
